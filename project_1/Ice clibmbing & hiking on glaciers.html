<i>Glacier</i> Experience is a small group experience that offers an easy glacier hike on Solheimajokull glacier with an experienced glacier guide and is available all year around. The tour offers a pick-up from Reykjavik or a meet on location<br/>
at Solheimajokull glacier. Add even more adventure to your stay in Iceland and come explore this amazing crawling glacier with us.
</p>

<p>
Solheimajokull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Myrdalsjokull and is surrounded by some of Iceland's most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charm of the<br/>
location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!
